        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Each player rolls a die and the highest number goes first and places their castle piece first. <br>
            Both players start with a castle piece that are placed on opposite sides of the board. They can be placed anywhere along their respective row.<br>
            Each player will take turns either building a road, traveling down a single road piece connected to their castle, or attacking an enemy road (edge).<br>
            You can only build a road within a 1 block distance from your current player piece.<br>
            You can only attack a road within a 1 block distance from the opponents current player piece.<br>
            For every attack action, there is a 3 turn cooldown<br>
            building or traversing is available on every turn<br>
            Attacking a road edge will render it unusable for the remainder of the game.<br>
            there must exist SOME path from castle to castle, if attacking a road makes it so that there is NO path then that attack is not valid.<br>
            attacks are on the specific edges of a tile instead of the entire tile itself. For example, there are 4 edges on any given tile, if you attack one side, there are still 3 other edges that the enemy can traverse from.<br>
            Roads built by the enemy can be traversed if it connects to your road<br>
            In the instance that both players are on the same road, they will commence in a battle<br>
            The player who initiated the battle (the one who moved onto the road) will gain a +1 to their dice roll. Then both players will roll a die, whoever rolls the highest numbers wins and they will gain an additional move (build, move, or attack) at no cost of a turn.<br>
